    1.Primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double
                  char, boolean

    2.Primitive Type Casting: Implicit - Explicit

        * implicit casting: casting a smaller primitive type to larger
        * explicit casting: casting a larger primitive type to smaller

    3.Wrapper Class : the objects that represents the primitives
                      enables us to use primitive data types in Collections and Maps
                      also have some useful methods
