Collections

    Data Structures
        Array
        Collection
        Map

    Array: size is fixed
           supports both primitives-non primitives
           supports only on type in an array

    Collection: size is dynamic
                supports ony non primitives
                supports different types of objects
                Collection is an interface

                List :  accepts duplicates
                         preserve put order
                         has index numbers


                         ArrayList : dynamic array
                                     Accessing the data is fast (get())

                         LinkedList : uses doubly linked list (previous nodes reference, data, next nodes reference)
                                      adding/removing is faster
                                      requires more memory size

                         Vector : internally uses array
                                  thread safe - synchronised

                         Stack : LIFO  (last in first out)
