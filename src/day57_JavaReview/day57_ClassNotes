JAVA REVIEW

    11. Constructor : constructor name should be exact same with the class name;
                      every class must have a constructor
                      initialize the every single instance variable
                      used for creating objects
                      if we don't create a constructor; Java will create a default constructor
                      constructor will execute whenever you create an object
                      can be overloaded
                      this()  --> constructor in same class
                      must be in the first line
                      only call one constructor
                      super() --> can be used in child classes to call the parent's constructor

    12. Class & Objects :
                     Class : A blueprint / template for objects
                             where objects come from
                             you can create as many objects as you want from a class

                     Objects : an instance of a class
                               each object has its own memory
