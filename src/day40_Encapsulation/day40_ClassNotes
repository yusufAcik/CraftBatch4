    Encapsulation:

            Access Modifiers:
                public    : always accessible at anywhere
                protected : Always visible within same package.
                            Accessible outside to sub classes only.
                default   : Always visible within same package.
                            Not accessible from outside packages
                private   : Visible within same class ONLY

    OOP : Object Oriented Programming
            Encapsulation : Hiding Data by giving private access modifier
                            use public getter&setter methods to read/write the data
                            TO HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF DATA

                            getter : read only, public instance method
                                     has a Return type
                                     Return type is same with the data type of the instance variable
                                     Has no parameter

                            setter : Write only, public instance method
                                     return type is void
                                     Has parameter
                                     Parameter type is same with the data type of the instance variable
